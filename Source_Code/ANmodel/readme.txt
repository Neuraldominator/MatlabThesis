AN and GBC data:
- ANdata: Containing simulated AN data at varied frequencies (200-3000 Hz, 40 and 70 dB). 
 After unzipping, you will have 58 matlab data files. These files were created by the 
 script "trainAN.m", which internally uses the Bruce-Zilany-2018 model. Each file contains 
 AN spike trains for 8000 repetitions, which are required for simulating GBC responses 
 (20 AN inputs x 400 trials = 8000 repetitions). You can use the first 400 repetitions
 for our manuscript (and the remaining data for checking the reproducibility across trials).

- GBCdata: Containing simulated GBC data at varied frequencies (200-3000 Hz, 40 and 70 dB).
 These files were created by the script "trainGBC.m", which internally uses the AN data and 
 the GBC model ("GBCmodelACC.m").

- plots: Containing PSTHs and calculated VS values for the simulated AN/GBC data. 
 These plots were created by the script "plotANGBC.m", which internally uses the spike trains
 in the folders "ANdata" and "GBCdata". This plot script internally calls "calcVSstats.m" for the
 calculation of VS and PSTH (and some other quantities like ISIH, which you can just ignore)


AN amplitude modulated:
I have made additional AN data driven with amplitude-modulated sounds.
Now the data files are in the "ANmod" folder. They were generated by "trainANmod.m."
In the "modplots" folder, you will also find some plots created with "plotANmod.m".

The point here is that phase-locking is measured with the modulation
envelope (100-1200 Hz), but not the carrier (7000 or 10500 Hz).

Unlike pure-tone stimulation, phase-locking to modulation envelopes
strongly depends on the stimulus level. I used 20, 40, 60 and 80 dB SPL,
and phase-locking is most prominent at 20 dB and worst at 80 dB.
This might be counterintuitive, but as you see in the PSTHs, spikes do
occur at non-preferred phases for high levels, which actually results in
low VS values.

With these data, I would expect some deviation from the theoretical VS-CI
curve, as the phase histogram would look different from the von Mises
distribution especially at high sound intensity levels.
