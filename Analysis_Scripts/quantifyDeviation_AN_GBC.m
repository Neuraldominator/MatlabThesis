% Calculate the amount of deviation between the theoretical and simulated 
% VS and CI values. This is done in two ways:
% (A) "the difference of the theo and sim VS values for the same CI 
%     (= deviation along the y-axis)" and 
% (B) "the difference of the theo and sim CI values for the same VS 
%     (= deviation along the x-axis)"
